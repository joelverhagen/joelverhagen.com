<p>I just finished a GUI to help manage the resource files generated by my <a href="{% url blog/2011/03/resource-file-manager-in-c/ %}">Resource File class</a>. The GUI is most excitingly called <b>Resource File Helper</b>. It is written with Qt 4.7.2 and is meant to make the process of reading and writing resource files a lot simpler. For example, if you want to use my Resource File class for your game, you can use this GUI to easily generate the resource file with a friendly graphic interface.</p>

<p>There current version is <b>version 1.0</b>.</p>
<h2>Download</h2>
<p>Here is a link to <a href="https://github.com/joelverhagen/Resource-File-Manager">my GitHub repository</a> for both the base class and the GUI.</p>
<h2>Preview</h2>
<p>On the <b>Read</b> tab, you can drag-and-drop an existing resource file (generated by my library, of course) to view its contents.</p>

<p>On the <b>Write</b> tab, you can drag-and-drop files onto the window to create a new resource file.</p>
