title: The fastest CSV parser in .NET
---

... at least according to my brief investigation.

For one of my side projects, I was using CSV files as an intermediate data format. Essentially I have an Azure Function
writing results to Azure Table Storage and another Function collecting the results into giant CSV files. These CSV files
get gobbled up by Azure Data Explorer allowing easy slice and dice with Kusto query language. Kusto is awesome by the
way.

To save money on the Azure Function compute time, I wanted to optimize all of the steps I could, including the CSV
reading and writing. Therefore, I naturally installed a bunch of CSV parsing libraries and tested their performance üòÅ.

## Specific needs

My goal was to find the fastest _low-level_ CSV parser. Essentially, all I wanted was a library that gave me a `string[]`
for each line where each field in the line was an element in the array. This is about as simple as you can get with a
CSV parser. I don't care about parsing headings or dynamically mapping fields to class properties. I can do all of that
myself faster than reflection with [C# Source Generators](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/master/docs/features/source-generators.md), rather trivially.

So if you want a feature-rich library and don't care as much about 1 millisecond vs 10 milliseconds, read no further and
just use [CsvHelper](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CsvHelper/). It's the "winner" from a popularity stand-point and has
good developer ergonomics in my experience. Using an established, popular library is probably the best idea since it's
most battle-tested and has the best examples and Q&A online.

And... I threw in two other implementations of my own:

- An implementation I called "HomeGrown" which is my first attempt at a CSV parser, without any optimization. ü§û
- An implementation simply using `string.Split`. This is broken for CSV files containing escaped comma characters, but I figured it could be a baseline.

## Methodology

I used BenchmarkDotNet to parse a CSV file I had laying around containing NuGet package asset information generated from
NuGet.org. It has a Good Mixture‚Ñ¢ of data types, empty fields, and string lengths. I ran several benchmarks for varying
file sizes -- anywhere from an empty file to one million lines.

I put each library in an implementation of some `ICsvReader` interface I made up that takes a `TextReader` and returns a
list of my [POCO](https://stackoverflow.com/a/910260) instances.

I used IL Emit for activating ("newing up"/"constructing") partly because this is [the fastest way to dynamically activate
objects](https://www.joelverhagen.com/blog/2020/11/dynamically-activate-objects-net) (given enough executions, via
initialization cost amortization). Also one of the libraries I tested hard codes this method for activation so I wanted
all of the libraries to have the same characteristics in this regard.

I tested execution time, not memory allocation. Maybe I'll update this post later to talk about memory.

## Results

These are the parse times for a CSV file with 1,000,000 lines. The units are in seconds.

As you can see the fast implementation is the broken `string.Split`. Not _too surprising_ since it doesn't even try to
handle CSV character escaping or fields surrounded by quotes. Said another way, it's not a real implementation unless
you know your data will never have quoted fields or escaped characters... or multiline fields... wanna take that bet?

The next fastest is the dark horse, the [**mgholam.fastCSV**](https://www.nuget.org/packages/mgholam.fastCSV) library!

Shockingly, the most popular **CsvHelper** came in 9th place parsing more than twice as slowly as the fastest solution.

Also, it should be noted that **mgholam.fastCSV** performed _better_ than `string.Split` some file sizes. This may be
between the margin of error, but clearly that library is doing something right!

Strangely, **mgholam.fastCSV** came in 9th place for empty files. I think this may because the version I tested
allocates a result list with an [initial size of 10,000 elements](https://github.com/mgholam/fastCSV/blob/10cabeac45a8ea201f44f856f49c16563431f429/fastCSV/fastCSV.cs#L170).
This is not ideal for an empty file.

Most shockingly, my **HomeGrown** implementation is not the worst. And the [code is beautiful](https://github.com/joelverhagen/NCsvPerf/blob/57c31aad520ad58147f240640efe1de8e6e22108/NCsvPerf/HomeGrown/CsvUtility.cs#L39) üò≠ (as a father says to his ugly kid).

## I'm talking smack?

Am I defaming your library? Point out what I missed! I make mistakes all the time üòÖ and I'm happy to adjust the report
if you can point out a legitimate flaw in my test.

I did my best to use the lowest level (and presumably highest performance?) API in each library. If I can adjust my
implementations to squeeze out more performance or be more truthful to the intended use of each library API. Let me
know or [open a PR](https://github.com/joelverhagen/NCsvPerf/pulls) against my test repository.

Feel free to reach out to me however you can figure out. (can't make it too easy for the spammers)

## Library-specific adapters

Each library-specific implementation is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/joelverhagen/NCsvPerf/tree/57c31aad520ad58147f240640efe1de8e6e22108/NCsvPerf/CsvReadable/Implementations).

All of the implementations look something like this:

```csharp
public List<T> GetRecords<T>(MemoryStream stream) where T : ICsvReadable, new()
{
    var activate = ActivatorFactory.Create<T>();
    var allRecords = new List<T>();

    using (var reader = new StreamReader(stream))
    {
        string line;
        while ((line = reader.ReadLine()) != null)
        {
            var pieces = line.Split(',');
            var record = activate();
            record.Read(i => pieces[i]);
            allRecords.Add(record);
        }
    }

    return allRecords;
}
```

The test was run on my home desktop PC which is Windows 10, .NET Core 3.1.9, and an AMD Ryzen 9 3950X CPU.
