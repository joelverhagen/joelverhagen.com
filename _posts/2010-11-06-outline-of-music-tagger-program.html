<p><em>Note: this is an old, old post and an old, old plan! Don't hold your breath for this one.</em></p>

<p>A few months ago, I stumbled upon a cute little GUI library called Qt (pun intended) for the first time. Yes, I <b>do</b> live under a rock. The truth is, most of my coding experience has either been web development (LAMP stack), Python, or Java. Since some wise person told me that Java and C++ are the bread and butter of the computer programming world, I realized I had better get my butt in gear and start learning C++. I'll tell you now, it's hard to learn. There, I said it. C++ is hard!</p>

<p>Anyways, I figured the best way to learn C++ is to start a big ol' project and see it all the way through. I decided to create an app that can analyze the information in my music library and fix errors. I started by making it a command line program... BORING. Why not make it a shiny, lickable GUI? Well, after a bit of research I decided Qt would be my man. I've waited a few weeks for Qt 4.7 to come out, so now I'm ready. This will be my setup for the project.</p>
<h2>Environment</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Operating system: Windows 7, 64-bit</li>
  <li>IDE: QtCreator 2.0.1</li>
  <li>Compiler: MinGW</li>
  <li><b>Note: </b>I'm using the LGPL Qt 4.7 SDK for Windows (with MinGW) bundled</li>
</ul>
<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://qt.nokia.com/" target="_blank">Qt</a>, the graphics library</li>
  <li><a href="http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib.html" target="_blank">TagLib</a>, the music tagging library (we'll have to build this ourselves, no binaries were made available)</li>
</ul>
