<p>A friend of mine recently told me about Microsoft's XNA Game Studio. Since I've kind of been interested in game programming for a while, I decided to give it a try. The only game programming I have ever done is playing around with good ol' <a href="http://www.pygame.org/">pygame</a>. Well, to be honest, first few hours of hacking around with XNA 4.0 has been very pleasant indeed. Here are a few discoveries I've made:</p>
<ol>
  <li>You can do it all for free! This is what I download to get going:
<ol>
  <li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads/#2010-Visual-CS">Visual C# 2010 Express</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=9ac86eca-206f-4274-97f2-ef6c8b1f478f">XNA 4.0 Game Studio</a> (requires some big downloads during installation)</li>
</ol>
</li>
  <li>I love C#. All XNA projects must be written in C#. At first I was worried, but C# is very nice to code in. It's good to be back in a static typing programming language.</li>
  <li>Microsoft has made it <b>really, really easy</b> to get started. There are 1,001 different tutorials out there about getting started. Here are a few that helped me out.
<ol>
  <li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_QqcFimkkg">A very basic YouTube tutorial</a> with explanations of the default functions that are part of your new XNA project's Game object.</li>
  <li><a href="http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=12394.0">Sprite Sheets and Animations tutorial</a>. This tutorial is really helping me out as I play with 2D animation.</li>
</ol>
