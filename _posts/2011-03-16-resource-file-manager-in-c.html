title: Resource File Manager in C++
---
<p>I have recently been spending a lot of time learning about game programming. One function I would like my game to have is to store all the resource or data files it uses into one big data file. There are a couple of reasons for this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Raw resources are hidden from the user, which provides a little bit of privacy.</li>
  <li>The is a reduced chance that the user will inadvertently delete a file necessary for the game to run.</li>
  <li>It's fun to do!</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a couple people out there that have already taken a hack at it and provided perfectly usable implementation (one on <a href="http://archive.gamedev.net/archive/reference/programming/features/pak/">GameDev.net</a>). However, I wrote my own because neither handles the problem of big-endian vs. little-endian memory and I wanted the experience of some hardcore C++ file I/O action.</p>

<p>To solve the big-endian vs. little-endian problem, I decided on how integers will be stored in my file (I chose little-endian because that's much more common) and I found a way to convert a C++ <code class="inline">int</code> to little-endian bytes. Someone on StackOverflow <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2100331/c-macro-definition-to-determine-big-endian-or-little-endian-machine#2103095">created a compact header file</a> to determine the endianness of the host machine.</p>

<p>From there, it was pretty easy to get things going. My finished product is called <b>Resource File Manager</b>. Generic enough for you? The current version is <b>version 1.0</b>. You can currently pack files into a larger file using <code class="inline">ResourceFileWriter</code> and read them back out again using <code class="inline">ResourceFileReader</code>.</p>

<p><b>Here's a <a href="https://github.com/joelverhagen/Resource-File-Manager/">GitHub repository</a> for the project.</b></p>

<p>I have successfully tested the classes in <b>MingW</b> and <b>Visual Studio 2010</b>.</p>

<p>Here's a short example of how the Resource File Manager is used.</p>
{% highlight cpp %}
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <sstream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

#include "ResourceFile.h"

int main()
{
    {
        // write test
        cout << "Write Test:" << endl;

        ResourceFileWriter writeTest("writeTest.dat");
        writeTest.addEntry("ball.png", "files/ball.png");
        writeTest.addEntry("audio.mp3", "files/audio.mp3");
        writeTest.addEntry("Text Document.txt", "files/Text Document.txt");
        writeTest.write();

        vector<string> entryNamesList = writeTest.getEntryNames();

        cout << "The following files were added to writeTest.dat." << endl;
        for(vector<string>::iterator i = entryNamesList.begin(); i != entryNamesList.end(); i++)
        {
            string entryName = (*i);
            cout << entryName << endl;
        }
    }

    cout << endl << endl;

    {
        // read test
        cout << "Read Test:" << endl;

        ResourceFileReader readTest("writeTest.dat");
        readTest.read();

        vector<string> entryNamesList = readTest.getEntryNames();

        cout << "The following files are in writeTest.dat." << endl;
        for(vector<string>::iterator i = entryNamesList.begin(); i != entryNamesList.end(); i++)
        {
            string entryName = (*i);
            cout << entryName << " (" << readTest.getEntryFileSize(entryName) << " bytes)" << endl;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
