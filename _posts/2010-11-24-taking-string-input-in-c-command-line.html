title: Taking String Input in C++ Command Line
---
<p>If you're learning C++, you've probably heard all about the basic input/output tools call <code class="inline">cin</code> and <code class="inline">cout</code>. Well, say you want to get string input from a user of your new command line program. I was having a pretty depressing day a while back and I wanted to make a program that gets to know me then complements me. Well, it's going to have to ask my name right? Well this is just too easy, right?</p>

{% highlight cpp %}
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "Computer: What's your full name?" << endl;

    cout << "You: ";
    string name;
    cin >> name;

    cout << "Computer: Hi, " << name << "! You're a real swell person!";

    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>And here was the output I got:</p>
{% highlight text %}
F:\Programming\ForBadDays\bin\Release>ForBadDays.exe
Computer: What's your full name?
You: Joel Verhagen
Computer: Hi, Joel! You're a real swell person!
F:\Programming\ForBadDays\bin\Release>{% endhighlight %}

<p>What the heck! Computer already forgot my last name! How do you think that makes me feel..</p>

<p>Well, what's really going on there is <code class="inline">cin</code> only reads in to the first space in the input. So if you type in "Emma Charlotte Duerre Watson", it would only store "Emma" in the <code class="inline">name</code> variable. This is how you get the whole line:</p>
{% highlight cpp %}
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "Computer: What's your full name?" << endl;

    cout << "You: ";
    string name;
    getline(cin, name);

    cout << "Computer: Hi, " << name << "! You're a real swell person!";

    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Notice how I used the <code class="inline">getline</code> function. Now the whole input up to the first <b>return </b>or <b>newline </b>character is stored in the <code class="inline">name</code> variable. And here is the example output:<p>
{% highlight text %}
F:\Programming\ForBadDays\bin\Release>ForBadDays.exe
Computer: What's your full name?
You: Joel Verhagen
Computer: Hi, Joel Verhagen! You're a real swell person!
F:\Programming\ForBadDays\bin\Release>
{% endhighlight %}
