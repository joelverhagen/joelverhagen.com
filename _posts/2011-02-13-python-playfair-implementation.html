title: Python Playfair Implementation

<p>I've been playing around with the Playfair cipher recently, so I thought it would be a fun little project to write a Python class that can encrypt and decrypt according to the Playfair cipher, so that's exactly what I did.</p>

<p>If you haven't heard of the Playfair cipher, check out <a href="{% url blog/2011/02/playfair-playing-fair-since-1854/ %}">my other post</a> about how it works.</p>

<p>As I said before, the class is written Python. I wrote it in Python 2.6 on a Windows 7 machine.</p>

<p>I have a <a href="https://github.com/joelverhagen/Python-Playfair">GitHub repository</a> set up for the project.</p>

<p>The current version of this class is <b>version 1.0</b>. Features include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can set the password you would like to encrypt and decrypt with.</li>
  <li>You can set the omission rule used to generate the 5 by 5 matrix. Current omission rules are:
<ul>
  <li>Replace J with I</li>
  <li>Omit Q</li>
  <li>Replace I with J</li>
</ul>
</li>
  <li>Set what character you would like to use to pad double letter digraphs and odd length inputs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an example script to demonstrate how easy it is to use...</p>

{% highlight python %}
# import the Playfair library
import playfair

# create a Playfair object for encrypting and decrypting
ph = playfair.Playfair()

# set the password for upcoming encryptions or decryptions
ph.setPassword('Caput Draconis')

# encrypt a plain text phrase and print it out
print ph.encrypt('Emma Watson is the most talented actress.')
{% endhighlight %}

<p>.. and the output.</p>
