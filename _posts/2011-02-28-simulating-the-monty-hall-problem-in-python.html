title: Simulating the Monty Hall Problem in Python
---
<p>I recently found out <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/wikipedia/comments/fu84k/the_monty_hall_problem_is_so_controversial_its/">via Reddit</a> that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">Monty Hall problem</a> page on Wikipedia has caused quite a lot of heated dispute, mainly because people don't agree on that way in which the problem is solved.</p>

<p>If you haven't heard of the Monty Hally problem, here's a quote found on the Wikipedia page that describes the problem.
<blockquote>Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?</blockquote>
<p>Well, I thought it would be interesting to simulate the problem in Python to show that it is in fact to your benefit to switch doors from your original choice.</p>

{% highlight python %}
import random

def test():
    doors = ['goat', 'goat', 'car'] # the three doors
    random.shuffle(doors) # not necessary, since the doors choice is randomized, but I want to simulate the game show as closely as possible
    
    playerPick = doors.pop(random.randint(0, len(doors) - 1)) # pick a random door
    hostPick = doors.pop(doors.index('goat')) # host picks one of the doors with a goat behind it
    
    prizes = {}
    
    noSwitchPrize = playerPick # The player does not switch doors.
    switchPrize = doors[0] # The player switches doors.
    
    return noSwitchPrize, switchPrize

def runTests(repititions):
    noSwitchCarCount = 0 # The number of times the car is won if the player does not switch doors.
    switchCarCount = 0 # The number of times the car is won if the player switches doors.
    
    for i in range(repititions):
        noSwitchPrize, switchPrize = test()
        noSwitchCarCount += 1 if noSwitchPrize == 'car' else 0 # count the game as a success if not switching the door results in winning a car
        switchCarCount += 1 if switchPrize == 'car' else 0 # count the game as a success if switching the door results in winnning a car
    
    return noSwitchCarCount, switchCarCount

repititions = int(raw_input("Repititions: ")) # input number of times we want to simulate the problem
noSwitchCarCount, switchCarCount = runTests(repititions)

print
print "Cars won if the player does not switch doors: "+str(noSwitchCarCount)+" ("+("%.2f" % (100 * (noSwitchCarCount / float(repititions))))+"% chance)"
print "Cars won if the player switches doors: "+str(switchCarCount)+" ("+("%.2f" % (100 * (switchCarCount / float(repititions))))+"% chance)"
print 
print "Based off of these tests, it is a better idea to "+("not " if noSwitchCarCount > switchCarCount else "")+"switch doors."
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Here is my output run running the test 1,000,000 times.</p>
{% highlight text %}
Repititions: 1000000

Cars won if the player does not switch doors: 332805 (33.28% chance)
Cars won if the player switches doors: 667195 (66.72% chance)

Based off of these tests, it is a better idea to switch doors.
{% endhighlight %}
<p>This is clearly not a textbook way of solving the problem, but it is evidence enough for me to believe the accepted answer.</p>
